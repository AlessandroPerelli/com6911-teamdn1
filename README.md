## How to use this repo

### Protected branch

For this repo, the main branch is protected. This means that work cannot be directly pushed onto it without a push request (which needs to be reviewed by two people). In order to do this follow the steps:

- Create a branch for the work you are doing. This could be `cnn-model` etc. Branches can be created using the command `git checkout -b name-of-branch`

- Push your work to this branch

- Go to the pull requests section of this repo and create a pull request to merge your branch into main (make sure it's into main)

- Wait for review approval

- Merge branch

Any questions regarding this, please let me know (Alessandro)

### Issues

Github issues is basically a task tool. You create an issue (task) and then assign it to someone to complete. I have created the ones for our classifier team as examples.

### Repo rules

- One issue per week per person - please try to keep to this, as to ensure equal and fair allocation of work

- Editing other people's work - I'm sure this will not happen, but please refrain from overriding the work of others especially cross sub-teams (knn and classifier). Suggestions are more than welcome (of course) but please let the sub-team know and allow someone from that team to implement it. This ensures fair allocation of work.

Any questions regarding anything about this repo, let me know (Alessandro)

Happy coding!
